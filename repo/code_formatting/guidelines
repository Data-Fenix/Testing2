We are using standard PEP 8 python code conventions - https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/ \
We use black - https://github.com/psf/black \
If you use visual studio code, you can install the `black formatter` extension \
If it does not work after restarting the app: copy `settings.json` into .vscode.
